                    <li>Scallions - 2</li>
                    <li>Peanuts - 1 bag</li>
                    <li>Sriracha - 1 packet</li>
                    <li>Garlic - 3 cloves</li>
                    <li>Butter - 2 tbsp</li>
                    <li>Cooking oil - 1 drizzle</li>
                    <li>Salt, Pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash and dry produce. In a small pot, combine rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-20 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
                    <li>While rice cooks, zest and quarter lime. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and finely chop garlic. Roughly chop peanuts.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine soy glaze, half the Sriracha (save the rest for serving), and juice from half the lime.</li>
                    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add pork and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until pork is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Add cabbage and carrot mix and stir until slightly softened, 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add soy glaze mixture and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) to pan. Stir until sauce has thickened and stir-fry is evenly coated, 1-2 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. Turn off heat.</li>
                    <li>Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Divide rice between bowls. Top with stir-fryand sprinkle with peanuts and scallion greens. Drizzle with as much remaining Sriracha as you like. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>

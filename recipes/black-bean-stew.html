        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>We consider ourselves unofficial presidents of the Soup & Stew Fan Club™, so you could say we have a few strong opinions on the matter. One thing we firmly believe? Black bean versions rank among the best. For this iteration, the beans are simmered in a richly-spiced, garlicky, tomato-laced veggie stock until they’re ultra-tender and the soup is thick. Of course, toppings are also a priority in the Soup & Stew Fan Club™, and these ones don’t disappoint: There’s melty Mexican cheese, tangy sour cream, and fresh scallions for loading up each bowl. Have we convinced you to join our club yet?</p>

                <li>Shredded Mexican Cheese - 1 bag</li>
                <li>Sour Cream - 1 packet</li>

                <li>Salt, Pepper, Cooking Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel, and finely dice onion. Core, deseed, and dice green pepper into ½-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and finely chop garlic. Dice tomato. Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving liquid.</li>
                <li>Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, green pepper, and scallion whites. Cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and Southwest Spice Blend; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Stir diced tomato, tomato paste, and ¾ of the Tex-Mex paste(use all the Tex-Mex paste if you like things spicy!) into pot until slightly darkened in color, 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Stir beans, stock concentrate, 1¾ cups water, and ¼ cup reserved bean liquid (3 cups water and ½ cup reserved bean liquid for 4 servings) into pot. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 5-8 minutes. (Psst—stew thickness is a personal choice! If you want yours thicker or thinner, simmer for a little more or a little less time. After all, you’re the chef.) Turn off heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Divide stew between bowls and top with cheese, sour cream, and scallion greens.</li>
            </ol>
